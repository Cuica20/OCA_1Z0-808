you can use the keyword this or super to access a member of the class or parent class that are accessible.
But this only can used for members of the current class.
Example:

public void displaySharkDetails() {
	System.out.print("Shark with age: "+super.getAge());
	System.out.print(" and "+super.size+" meters long");
	System.out.print(" with "+super.numberOfFins+" fins"); // DOES NOT COMPILE
}

The correct:

public void displaySharkDetails() {
	System.out.print("Shark with age: "+super.getAge());
	System.out.print(" and "+super.size+" meters long");
	System.out.print(" with "+this.numberOfFins+" fins");
}
