 * There are two key points to note about the constructor: the name of the constructor
 * matches the name of the class, and there’s no return type.
 * <p>
 * When you see a method name beginning with a capital letter and having a return type,
 * pay special attention to it. It is not a constructor since there’s a return type. It’s a regular
 * method that won’t be called when you write new Chick()<br>
 * <code>public void Chick() { } // NOT A CONSTRUCTOR</code>
