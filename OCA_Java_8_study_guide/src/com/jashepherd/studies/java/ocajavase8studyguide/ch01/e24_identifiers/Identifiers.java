 * There are only three rules to remember for legal identifiers:
 * <ol>
 * <li>The name must begin with a letter or the symbol $ or _.
 * <li>Subsequent characters may also be numbers.
 * <li>You cannot use the same name as a Java reserved word. As you might imagine, a
 * reserved word is a keyword that Java has reserved so that you are not allowed to use it.
 * Remember that Java is case sensitive, so you can use versions of the keywords that only
 * differ in case. Please don't, though.</li>
 * </ol>
