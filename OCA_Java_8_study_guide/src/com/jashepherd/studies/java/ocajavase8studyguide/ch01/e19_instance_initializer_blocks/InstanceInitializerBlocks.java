/**
 * Chapter 1: Java Building Blocks<br/>
 * Creating Objects<br/>
 * Instance Initializer Blocks - page 18
 * <p>
 * The code between the braces is called a code block.
 * <p>
 * Sometimes code blocks are inside a method. These are run when the method is called.
 * Other times, code blocks appear outside a method. These are called instance initializers.
 * <p>
 * In this class there are three code blocks and one instance initializer. Counting code blocks is easy:
 * you just count the number of pairs of braces. If there aren't the same number of open ({)
 * and close (}) braces, the code doesn't compile. It doesn't matter that one set of braces is
 * inside the main() method, it still counts.
 * <p>
 * When counting instance initializers, keep in mind that it does matter whether the braces
 * are inside a method. There's only one pair of braces outside a method. Line 26 is an instance
 * initializer.
