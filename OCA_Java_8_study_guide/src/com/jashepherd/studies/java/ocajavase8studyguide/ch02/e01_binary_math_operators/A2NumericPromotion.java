 * Working with Binary Arithmetic Operators<br/>
 * Numeric Promotion - pages 55-56
 * <p>
 * Numeric Promotion Rules:
 * <ol>
 * <li>If two values have different data types, Java will automatically promote one of the values
 * to the larger of the two data types.</li>
 * <li>If one of the values is integral and the other is floating-point, Java will automatically
 * promote the integral value to the floating-point value's data type.
 * <li>Smaller data types, namely byte, short, and char, are first promoted to int any time
 * they're used with a Java binary arithmetic operator, even if neither of the operands is int.</li>
 * <li>After all promotion has occurred and the operands have the same data type, the resulting
 * value will have the same data type as its promoted operands.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <i>For the third rule, note that unary operators are excluded from this rule</i>
